# Awesome R package development [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) [![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/IndrajeetPatil/awesome-r-pkgtools/)

A curated list of awesome tools for R package development. Inspired by awesome-... stuff.

N.B.:

- Not all tools are available on CRAN; some might be available only via GitHub or GitLab.
- Only tools helpful for package development are included, and not other resources like books, talks, presentations, etc.

If you wish to suggest any additional tools, please make a PR request here:
